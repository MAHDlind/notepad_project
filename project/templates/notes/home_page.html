                This web application was developed using
                <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" class="site">Django</a>, a powerful and flexible Python
                framework.

            <p>
                This is a simple note-taking web app where registered users can create, edit, and delete their personal
                notes.
                The application features user authentication, dashboard access, and secure data management using
                Djangoâ€™s built-in user system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main purpose of this project is to practice building secure, functional, and user-friendly web
                applications using Django.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also serves as a foundation for future upgrades, such as adding categories, search functionality, and
                a more advanced UI.
